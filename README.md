# Penis-Project
I use a dataset from data.world of global penis data that consists of length, girth, and volume.
Visualized and Analyzed using R attempting to accomplish the following:

   -Go into sampling bias and look at regional measurements
  
   -Look at whether length is a good indicator of girth (and vice versa)
  
   -See what the average growth factor is for length, girth, and volume across different regions
